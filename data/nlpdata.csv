Investment emissions,https://qutii.org/index.php/Investment_emissions,Pollution,Why are emissions associated with investments important?,"It matters for two reasons: firstly, it is important to have an accurate understanding of the true scale of the emissions generated by the richest people in our society and the role that these emissions are playing in climate breakdown. Research conducted by Oxfam shows that while the personal consumption emissions of billionaires can be a thousand times higher than those of ordinary citizens, emissions from billionaire investments can be a million times higher than normal people [2]. Secondly, by looking at how the richest behave as investors, we can demonstrate not just their role as consumers of carbon but also their role as wealth holders who own, control, shape and financially profit from production processes that release greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere [2].",o/a
Investment emissions,https://qutii.org/index.php/Investment_emissions,Pollution,Why is understanding and directing the investments of the wealthy important?,"Ordinary citizens often do not have a lot of control over their energy choices, particularly those in low- or middle-income groups. Poor public transport options can mean that people are forced to drive to work, for example. In contrast, investors can choose where they put their money. They can choose to put it into fossil fuel industries or other highly polluting activities, or into the activities of other corporate actors that are clearly failing to do enough to reduce their carbon emissions. The decisions that investors make now can potentially determine our emissions for decades to come – for instance, bad decisions on infrastructure investments can commit us to high levels of GHGs far into the future [2].",s
Investment emissions,https://qutii.org/index.php/Investment_emissions,Pollution,How do mortality rates compare for extreme weather events for vulnerable and non-vulnerable countries?,"The IPCC state that average mortality levels from floods, drought and storms over the past decade are 15 times higher for countries that are highly vulnerable to climate change – such as Mozambique, Somalia, Nigeria, Afghanistan and Haiti – compared with regions and countries that have low vulnerability, such as the UK, Australia, Canada and Sweden [8].",a
Investment emissions,https://qutii.org/index.php/Investment_emissions,Pollution,What role do investors have in fighting for climate change?,"During company engagement, shareholders should take a position on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues and demand that the targeted corporates improve their practices over time. This can be a powerful lever to reduce the carbon footprint of large companies. Where shareholder engagement fails, investors can decide to disinvest.[1]",s
Investment emissions,https://qutii.org/index.php/Investment_emissions,Pollution,How do emissions from the investments of pension funds differ from those of billionaire investments?,"The billionaires in the sample analysed by Oxfam fund 393m tonnes of CO2e per year, and the average emissions for each billionaire's investment are 3m tonnes of CO2e. By way of comparison, the average UK pension pot funds 23 tonnes of CO2e [[https://www.cushon.co.uk/blog/pension-funds-and-the-climate-crisis 10]]",a
Investment emissions,https://qutii.org/index.php/Investment_emissions,Pollution,Why do estimates underestimate emissions related to the investments of billionaire's?,"Firstly, most corporate reporting is voluntary, and most is not of adequate quality. There are international standards and guidelines for measuring climate data, such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol; however, as one analysis points out, ‘poor sustainability performers prefer low-quality sustainability disclosure to disguise their true performance’.58 This means that there is a systematic underestimation by corporates of their reported emissions [11]. Secondly, for most corporates, the majority of emissions (on average 75%) are indirect scope 3 emissions. Scope 3 emissions from the oil and gas sector are even higher, accounting for about 88% of total emissions.61 A low-carbon economy cannot be achieved without addressing these emissions[12].",o/a
Investment emissions,https://qutii.org/index.php/Investment_emissions,Pollution,What role have coporates had in the climate breakdown?,"In March 2022, CDP found that, of the 13,000+ corporates that disclosed in 2021 – between them accounting for 64% of global market capital ($64tn) – just one-third (4,002) were developing a low-carbon transition plan. Fewer than 35% of corporates’ emissions reductions targets are what CDP consider credible and only 1,164 organizations have set science-based targets (SBTs) validated by the SBTi. Moreover, a paltry 1% of corporates (135) reported on all 24 of the CDP key indicators associated with a credible climate transition plan [13] . None of the G7 countries have a corporate sector that is aligned with the Paris agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. [2].",o/a
Investment emissions,https://qutii.org/index.php/Investment_emissions,Pollution,How can governments compel investors to reduce carbon emissions?,"They should regulate to compel corporates to set strong and binding science-based targets to reduce carbon emissions to within the 1.5°C limit and must demand greater transparency and a unified and higher standard of reporting. This should be done though disclosure from the companies, ambitious but realistic targets and just planning. To speed the transition away from fossil fuels, investments in new fossil fuel extraction and use and in highly polluting industries should be strictly regulated and indeed banned in many instances. This can be complemented with steeply progressive rates of taxation. [2].",s
Investment emissions,https://qutii.org/index.php/Investment_emissions,Pollution,,Governments should tax wealth in order to reduce the numbers of very rich people in our society and their power.

Decarbonization Day Decarbonization in Japan,https://qutii.org/index.php/Decarbonization_Day_Decarbonization_in_Japan,pollution,What are CO2 emissions per real GDP and how have they evolved over time in Japan?,"CO2 emissions per real GDP measure energy intensity and CO2 emission intensity. Energy intensity assesses how much energy is used to produce one unit of real GDP: the lower the energy intensity, the more efficient the source is. CO2 emission intensity estimates the CO2 emitted to produce one unit of energy: the lower the CO2 emission intensity is, the more decarbonised the energy source is.",s
Decarbonization Day Decarbonization in Japan,https://qutii.org/index.php/Decarbonization_Day_Decarbonization_in_Japan,pollution,,"Following the 1970s global energy crisis, energy intensity improved in Japan until the 1990s, thanks to the introduction of energy-saving technologies and more durable consumer goods. The improvement slowed to a halt in the 2000s due to capital constraints following the dot-com bubble and began improving again in the mid-2000s. Similarly, CO2 emission intensity improved until the 1990s, then stagnated until the mid-2000s. CO2 emission intensity increased following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, due to the closure of nuclear power plants across the country and the subsequent increased use of fossil fuels to power the country. [3]",s
Decarbonization Day Decarbonization in Japan,https://qutii.org/index.php/Decarbonization_Day_Decarbonization_in_Japan,pollution,How does the Japanese government plan to reduce the CO2 emissions?,"According to the 6th Strategic Energy Plan formulated by the Japanese Government, reducing the country's emissions can be achieved through mitigated energy intensity and emission intensity. First, the plan forecasts a decrease in overall energy consumption thanks to an increase in energy conversation. Second, the plan highlights the change needed in the energy mix (the sources of energy that power a country) to decrease emissions. To decarbonise its economy and reach this target, Japan aims to increase its share of renewables, restore nuclear power sources and decrease its share of fossil fuels. The country plans to prioritise fossil fuels with lower emissions such as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). [4]",s
Decarbonization Day Decarbonization in Japan,https://qutii.org/index.php/Decarbonization_Day_Decarbonization_in_Japan,pollution,What are the transition risks involved in Japan's decarbonisation process and how do they affect the economy?,"Transition risks occur when a country shifts to a low-carbon economy. These changes will affect the economy of the country. The main transition risks for Japan are energy prices and productivity. Decarbonisation will affect energy prices: a shift in the sources of energy required to produce electricity will involve a decrease in fossil fuels and an increase in renewables and nuclear power. Fluctuations in the price of renewables and fossil fuels would have a reasonably large impact on the real economy. Decarbonisation will also affect productivity: an improvement in energy intensity means that less energy is consumed, leading to more efficient and productive use of resources. Improvement in CO2 emission intensity is less straightforward. On the one hand, the cost to comply with environmental regulations might decrease productivity. On the other hand, goods that emit less CO2 might be positively viewed by consumers, thus creating added value. [5]",s

No Net Loss of biodiversity (NNL),https://qutii.org/index.php/No_Net_Loss_of_biodiversity_(NNL)?veaction=edit,biodiversity,What is the justification backing compensation credits?,"There is a strong economic justification for incentives that encourage private land owners towards nature focused management of their land including payments for ecosystem services as well as confirmation of benefits of ecological restoration. The rationale behind market driven instruments for biodiversity conservation is that positive and negative impacts on biodiversity can be measured and represented as credits and debts, and as such can be integrated in economic-decision making.[2]",s
No Net Loss of biodiversity (NNL),https://qutii.org/index.php/No_Net_Loss_of_biodiversity_(NNL)?veaction=edit,biodiversity,How do compensation credits work?,"A business may have to pay for regulatory mitigation of its biodiversity impact, or may wish to contribute to a voluntary net-positive impact on ecosystems thus improving its image and reputation towards its customers. Likewise, if a landowner may gain a profit from protecting or restoring a habitat, they may provide more habitat protection than they would have done without compensation.[3]",t

No Net Loss of biodiversity (NNL),https://qutii.org/index.php/No_Net_Loss_of_biodiversity_(NNL)?veaction=edit,biodiversity,Biodiversity Offsets vs biodiversity credits,"Biodiversity offsets are relatively common in many countries and are used to compensate for biodiversity loss with a goal to create a ""no net loss"", or even a net gain of biodiversity often connected to land exploitation for building, mining and other activities with negative environmental impact. Biodiversity offsets are often a legal requirement in many countries in order to obtain, for example, an exploitation permit by a state agency. Biodiversity credits, on the other hand, are not a legal requirement, and can therefore be used to describe a positive biodiversity impact resulting from a targeted action towards that purpose.[5]",t
